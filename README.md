# GPA & CGPA Calculator üìä

This is a C++ program that calculates **GPA** and **CGPA** based on user input. It supports calculations for multiple semesters and includes options to input subject marks and credits for accurate results.

## Features ‚ú®

- **GPA Calculation**: Calculates GPA for a given number of subjects with marks and credits.
- **CGPA Calculation**: Computes the CGPA based on results from multiple semesters.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable for different credit systems or additional subjects.
- **Menu-driven Interface**: Users can choose between GPA, CGPA, and a method explanation for the calculations.

## How It Works üîß

1. **GPA Calculation**: The program allows the user to input the marks and credits for each subject, then calculates the GPA based on predefined credit-weighted formulas.
2. **CGPA Calculation**: Users can enter the results for each semester, and the program calculates the CGPA by averaging the semester results.
3. **Method**: Provides an explanation of how calculations are performed for GPA and CGPA.

## Files üìÇ

- `cgpamy.cpp`: The C++ file containing the logic for GPA and CGPA calculations.
- `README.md`: This readme file.

## Prerequisites ‚öôÔ∏è

- A C++ compiler like GCC, Clang, or MSVC.

## Compilation and Execution üèóÔ∏è

1. **Compilation**:
   To compile the program, use the following command (assuming you're using GCC):

   ```bash
   g++ cgpamy.cpp -o cgpamy
   ```

2. **Execution**:
   Once compiled, run the program using:

   ```bash
   ./cgpamy
   ```

## User Interaction üìù

1. **GPA Calculation**:
   - The program will ask for the number of subjects.
   - For each subject, enter the credits and marks.
   - The GPA will be calculated based on predefined rules for different credits (e.g., 3-credit subjects or 2-credit subjects).

2. **CGPA Calculation**:
   - The program will ask how many semesters' results you want to enter.
   - Enter the result for each semester, and the program will calculate your CGPA.

3. **Method for Calculations**:
   - The program explains the calculation methods used for GPA and CGPA.

## Example üí¨

Upon running the program, the user will see a menu like:
